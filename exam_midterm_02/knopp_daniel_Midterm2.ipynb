        "The methodology for this problem was quite simple. I used the property of a max heap to get the top k frequent values. Since a max heap always has the maximum value on the top, if I want the top k values I just need to pop the top node off k times (each time I pop of the node, the tree is reorganized by swapping the top node with the bottom node, then removing the bottom node, and finally sorting the new top node accordingly to maintain the max heap structure). Before creating my heap, I first used a dictionary to count the occurances of each number in the list and store the frequency of occurance as the values to each unique number key. Then, it was simpler for me to convert the dictionary into a tuple because the heapify() method would automatically sort tuples in a list based on the first element (which I made sure was the frequency). \n",
        "\n",
        "I chose to use the heapq package instead of building my own heap for simplicity. I understand how these methods work and thus didn't find it necessary to recreate them since it was not required. As I mentioned earlier, once the heap was built I then just needed to sequentially pop off the top k elements and store their numbers (not frequencies) into a results list to return to the user. \n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity for this function is O(n + n + n + k\\*log(n)) -> O(n + k\\*log(n)) in the average case or O(n + n + n\\*log(n) + k\\*log(n)) -> O((n+k)\\*log(n)) in the worst case where n is the number of elements in the list and k is the number of top elements we are concerned with. Each of these are mentioned in comments in the code below in their respective orders. The most significant terms come from the heapify() step and the popping of the top k values from the heap. For the heapify() method, on average the elements will be organized into a max heap using n steps becuase in the best case it only takes the depth of the tree but for the worst case (when the array is in the opposite order it needs to be) it can take n\\*log(n) becuase you must swap a node every time you add a new one. Since the worst case scenario is quite rare, the average case is commonly what is used. For the popping code, each time a node is removed it must first be swapped with the end-node (node at the bottom of the heap), then removed, and then the new top node (which used to be the bottom one) must be swapped down the tree until the none of its children are greater than it - this results in a time complexity of O(log(n)). \n",

        "The space complexity for this function is O(2u + 2u + k) -> O(u + k) where u is the number of unique elements in the input list and k is the number of top elemnts we care about. This is because we store the frequencies of each unique value in the input list first in a dictionary and then also in the tuple which gets sorted to become the heap. Then the results array stores the top k frequent elements. If we wanted to be more efficient, we could compute the frequencies directly with a list of tuples instead of as a dictionary first. \n",

        "It took me a very long time to figure out how to approach this problem. I chose to use dynamic programming as it seemed like the most efficient method. This problem is very complex and hard to visualize, so I created a visualization table in my output to help explain what is going on in the algorithm. To tackle the problem, as with many dynamic programming solutions, I tried to break up the problem into smaller pieces. First, I wanted to start with only the smallest denomination and figure out how many ways I could produce each number from 0 to n using just that one coin. Of course, this is trivial and I can only ever make change for each number using my 1 available coin. Building on this base, though, I can then add the ability to use a second coin - the 5 cent piece (for example). The way this algorithms works is essentially nothing changes while I'm allowed to use the new coin until I can actually use it (this is what the if statement is for in my code below). Once I can use my new coin, I can still arrive at the specific amount using only 1 cent coins as I figured out earlier, but now I can also use a 5 cent piece. The total number of unique combinations of coins is then simply the number of unique combos from the previous row of the table plus the number of unique combinations of my current row in the table when I subtract the coin I am using from the current value. This can be visualized by each element in the [1, 5] row being the sum of the row above it plus and value 5 elements to the left (assuming you are passed the value of 5 and are able to use the new coin). This same procedure is repeated for each new coin that is added - with the difference being that you are summing the previos row with the value in the current row x elements to the left (where x is the value of the coin - for example [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100]). \n",
        "\n",
        "To keep track of the unique combinations, I had to use a very complex data structure. The easiest way I could think of was to use a dictionary of lists of tuples. Let's break it down from the outside in. At the base level, I have a dictionary whos keys are the various possible amounts from 0 to n. The values of this dictionary are lists that contain all the possible unique coins that could be used to make change for the specific amount. Each element of this list is a tuple where each element of the tuple is the number of each coin that is used in the unique combination. The indices inside the tuple match the corresponding indices for each coin in the 'denoms' list that specifies the coins we can use. During the algorithm, each time I use a new coin I need to add the new coin to all possible combinations for the previous value (the element in the table x elements to the left). I do this by creating a helper function to sum tuples element-wise and each time I add a coin, I add a corresponding tuple that maps to just that individual coin (for example, adding a 10 cent coin would be the tuple: (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) given that my denoms list is [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100]). At the end of the function, I can then convert each unique combination tuple into an easy-to-read string using another helper function I made. Finaly, I output the total number of combinations for the requested amount and all the explicit unique combinations possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of this algorithms is O(n*d) where n is the target amount and d is the number of unique coin denominations. This is due to the nested for loop inside the algorithm; for each denomination, we compute all possible combinations for each incremental amount as the sum of 2 previously known (memorized) values in the ways array. The space complexity of this algorithm is the amount of space required to keep track of the total number of unique ways to arrive at the number (size of the ways array = target amount, n) and the total amount of space required to store the combos dictionary. If I was not also printing out each of the unique combinations, the space complexity would simply be O(n) where n is the target amount. Since I am storing all unique combinations, the space complexity of the combos dictionary is O(n * $c_{n}$ * d) where n is the total amount, $c_{n}$ is the number of unique combinations for each amount, and d is the number of unique coin denominations. As you can see, including a printout of all the unique combinations is very space consuming compared to just counting the number of possible ways and becomes the dominant factor when considering space constraints. \n",

        "To solve this problem, I decided to implement a method very similar to dynamic programming for the fibbonacci sequency. This time, however, instead of summing the previous 2 values, I needed to sum the previos m values where m is the length of the step_sizes array (for example [1, 2, 3]). The reason for this is that I know the last unique step I can take to get to my target step is one of my step_size values away. So, the number of unique ways to get to my target step is just the sum of the number of unique ways to get within 1 step_size of the target step. A fundamental assumption of this code is that the order of steps matters (i.e. taking 1 step then 3 is unique compared to 3 steps then 1).\n",

        "As with using dynamic programming for the fibbonacci sequence, it is easiest to first define my base case of how many ways to do nothing (get to step 0, or don't move) or to get to the first step. I am assuming the step_sizes array will always start with 1 and increment by 1 up to a max step_size of m. Then I just need to loop over all integers between 2 (first uncomputed step) and the target step and compute the sum of the unique ways to get to the previous m steps. I need to take extra caution when computing the number of unique ways to get to a step that is within a step_size of the base of the staircase - for those unique instances I need to add an extra unique way besides the sum of the previous m steps because the child can just step from the base of the staircase directly onto the target step. Also, for steps within a step_size of the base of the staircase I have to be careful not to request an index outside the bounds of my ways array (there is no logical sense of a negative step) - this is handled simply through an if statement (see code below).\n",

Due to its inherently easy to learn nature along with object oriented features, Python is used to develop and demonstrate applications quickly. It has the batteries included philosophy wherein the standard programming language  comes  with  a  rich  set  of  built-  in  libraries.  It's  a  known  fact  that  developers spend most of their time reading code rather than writing it and Python  can  speed  up  software  development.  Hosting  solutions  for  Python  applications are also very cheap. The Python Software Foundation (PSF) nur-tures the growth of the Python programming language. A versatile language like  Python  can  be  used  not  only  to  write  simple  scripts  for  handling  file  operations but also to develop massively trafficked websites for corporate IT organizations [1].\n",

For  now  we'll  discuss  some  of  the  Python  tools  most  widely  used  by  developers,  coders  and data scientists across the world. These tools are useful for many different purposes if you know how to use them correctly. So, without further delay, let's look at the best Python tools out there!\n",

        "To initialize this problem, I just used the Node class from my Goup Project 2 code. This is very similar to the pre-existing code that was in the template, but was in a format I was more familiar with. I did modify my GP2 class to include the additional attributes (content and dictionary of terms) that are needed for this question. I also added a debugging method that printed the content of each chapter along with the table of contents so that I could make sure that my pre-processing steps (getting content into the book) were working properly. The output of that code is shown above. \n",

At each node, the process for populating the dictionary of terms was very simple and was actually the same as I used previously on question 1 - loop over all words, if the word doesn't exist, initialize the frequency to 1, if the word does exist in the dictionary, then increment the frequency number. After this procedure is complete, I have a fully populated dictionary of terms for each node (chapter/subchapter) that contains all words that have occured and their frequency of occurance. \n",

        "<b>Word Searching: </b> Once the indexing is complete, it is very easy to search the book for a specific word occurance in each chapter/subchapter. All I needed to do was create a function that looped over every node in the book and checked to see if the search word exists in the dictionary of terms. If it did, then I added it to a list of outputs along with the corresponding chapter that was searched. Finally, I created a second function just to format the output (was simpler to do it with 2 functions since I used recursion for the searching) and only look at the top 20 results. Since there weren't more than 20 chapters/subchapters, this last filtering step didn't actually do anytihng. If I had input the full content of the entire book, however, then the top 20 filtering would have been useful.\n",
